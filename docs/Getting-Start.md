# Getting Started with MRtest APIs

#### **Get an Authorization Key**

Get an Authorization (API) Key by creating a customer account in MRtest. Your Authorization Key will be emailed to you after you've provided details needed to create an account, and have verified your email. You can use the same key for every Medirecords product you invoke.
